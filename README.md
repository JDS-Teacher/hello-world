# hello-world
This is my repository (following the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), in which I get to know GitHub. Starting from scratch... 

Why I'm doing this? 
Actually I'm a teacher from Germany, who's using GitHub for the first time to stay tuned on a project, that two students of mine are developing for our school in november / december 2020. And since teachers are learners, too, my students invited me to do this on GitHub! Looking forward to do this.
